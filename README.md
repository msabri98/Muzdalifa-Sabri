I am a resourceful professional specializing in inventory management, team mentorship, and process improvement. My journey is characterized by a deep understanding of Lean Six Sigma principles, advanced information system management, and a unique ability to navigate complex organizational structures to foster positive employee relations.

Currently, I am set to complete a 6-month Business Intelligence Analyst program with Tripleten this April 2024, where I am enhancing my expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI among other key technologies. This will further equip me to blend my leadership, problem-solving, and bilingual communication skills into a Data Analyst or management role. My background includes significantly reducing equipment loss by 98% through meticulous inventory control, driving customer satisfaction as an Insurance Agent, and contributing to community engagement recognized across the East Coast.

I hold a Green Belt certification in Lean Six Sigma, underlining my dedication to continuous process improvement. As I look forward to completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, my goal is to leverage my versatile skill set to drive data-driven decision-making and process optimization in challenging environments.

Please feel free to connect with me here on Github or via LinkedIn or email at mscramer98@gmail.com. If you happen to know of any data analyst positions that align with my interests and skills, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations. I'm excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations.</p>
